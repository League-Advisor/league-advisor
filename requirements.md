# Vision

_League of Legends is a fast-paced MOBA game, once pre-match stage is complete and enemy team composition is revealed,_

_a player has to start planning their build path for the entire match. Every and each champion has an ideal build path that brings out the best of the character,_

_but they still need to keep in mind who are they facing on the opposite side. A player often has to do lots of mental math in order to figure out what should they_

_go for and in which order, while keeping in mind the frequent adjustment and changes that champions and items go through almost every other week._

# Scope (In/Out)

- _The program will provide the list of champions and there specifecation(speed, attack damage, armor)_
- _The program will provide the role of each hero or in other word the point of strength_
- _The program will ask for a specific champion and will return a list of optimal items
  so that i can determine which items he will choose_
- _the program will ask for the hero which the user choosed and then will ask for the rest of team member champions and then
  will ask for enemy team champions and then will provide you with a list of optimal items_

# Minimum Viable Product vs

**CLI program that provides the following:**

- _A way for the user to enter their current champion and both team compositions._
- _A data base of items and champions to process the inputs._
- _A web scraper that collects up-to-date data regarding the best build paths ideally._
- _A data model that elects the best possible situational build path based on the situation._
- _Outputs an accurate build path recommendation based on user situation input._

# Functional Requirements

_The program will automaticlly update the content of data when it run
the user can search all of champions data and appiltys as well as items benefits_

# Non-Functional Requirements

_Testability for rules function as well as update function_
_the test in our application will comapre the function which is responible for creating the content file with the function which will preview the rules of the game to the user
and another test will compair the function which will create the update file content with the function which will be responseble for previewing the updates on the game for the user_
