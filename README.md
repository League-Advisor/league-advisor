# League Advisor

### We are deployed on **GitHub**!

[League Advisor](https://github.com/League-Advisor/league-advisor)

## CLI Program

_This CLI program consists of a frontend written in python._

The program provides recommended item builds based on the user's team and enemy team composition.

_League of Legends is a fast-paced MOBA game, once pre-match stage is complete and enemy team composition is revealed, a player has to start planning their build path for the entire match._

_Every and each champion has an ideal build path that brings out the best of the character, but they still need to keep in mind who are they facing on the opposite side._

_A player often has to do lots of mental math in order to figure out what should they go for and in which order, while keeping in mind the frequent adjustment and changes that champions and items go through almost every other week._

## Planned Features

**_CLI program that provides the following:_**

• A way for the user to enter their current champion and both team compositions.

• A data base of items and champions to process the inputs.

• A web scraper that collects up-to-date data regarding the best build paths ideally.

• A data model that elects the best possible situational build path based on the situation.

• Outputs an accurate build path recommendation based on user situation input.
